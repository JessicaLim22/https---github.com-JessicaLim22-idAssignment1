# idAssignment1
This is my ID assignment 1 which is an about me website, which includes my resume page, portfolio page and contact page. I did this website about me to summarise and showcase what I have learnt, experienced and done throughtout all my years of studies as well as working.

Design process
- As a user type, I would like to see the space being used up
- As a user type, I want the webisite to be interactive
- As a user type, I will want the information to be easily readable along with the pictures
- As a user type, I want to see relevent information provide according to the website title
- As a user type, I want to be able to look at the webiste on the phone
Thus, I designed it like this. With the images and information side by side, so that user doesnt have to scroll down to read information about the images as well as having the images taking up the whole space will make my website look lengthy.Firstly for my homepage, there is navigation bar at the top, and users can hover over the different words and the background color will change. Below it, there is a slideshow which contains different images of me to indicate to the users about my style and hobby and users are able to click on the arrows to change the images .They can also change the slideshow images using the dots below. Next, there is also an individual photo of me as well as infomation at the side. i added a youtube video of my favourite hobby with information on the side on why i added this video. Secondly, my resume page illustrates some of my education, work experiences and volunteer experience with all the information summarised at the side of the title to let users know that these are all the experiences that i experienced from my previous years. For portfolio page, it displayed some of the projects that i have done using adobe illustrator etc as well as some certificates that i have acheived with information at the side. Users will be able to hover over the images and it will show an animation of zooming in. Next, for my contact page, it provided infomations on how to contact me. There are also forms that users can fill in and submit. The form will check for validations for the correct inputs. There are also social media icons which users will be able to click on it and it will prompt them to the website of the social media as well as a linkined button when user hover over, the background color will change and when click, will prompt them to my linkinedin account. Lastly, the colours that i choose for this website are black, white, light coal and light purple because they are contradicting colors as well as i think the colors represents me and this is a website about me. Therefore, i chose these color. I also did media screens for mobiles and this is how it looks like. All the feature is still usable. For example, the slideshow, portfolio images zooming in animation and etc.
