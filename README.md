# idAssignment1
This is my ID assignment 1 which is an about me website, which includes my resume page, portfolio page and contact page. I did this website about me to summarise and showcase what I have learnt, experienced and done throughtout all my years of studies as well as working.

Design process
- As a user type, I would like to see the space being used up
- As a user type, I want the webisite to be interactive
- As a user type, I will want the information to be easily readable along with the pictures
- As a user type, I want to see relevent information provide according to the website title
- As a user type, I want to be able to look at the webiste on the phone
Thus, I designed it like this. With the images and information side by side, so that user doesnt have to scroll down to read information about the images as well as having the images taking up the whole space will make my website look lengthy. I also added slideshow as well as youtube video to make my content more interactive and interesting. For my portfolio, I added animation for all the images, so that when hover the image will zoom in which will make it more interactive for the users. I have also put all the titles in a different color so that users will be able to differentiate between the title and the paragragh for all informations. I have also inputted social medias icon and button, so when user click on the icons or button it will bring them to the offical website to make the website more interactive and appealing. The reason why i just black, lightcoral and light purple is because they are all contrasting color and I ask my friends for feedback and they said that this 2 color suits me. Hence, it is the reason why I put this 3 colors as this website is about me and I want to the color of the website to some what relate back to me. I also did media screen size for 390px and 768px so that users will be able to view the website on their phones or tablets and everything will also be alighed in a way of images followed by information as on phone or tablet, it will be easier to view it like this as if the images and information is size by side, the images and words will be packed together which result in font becoming too small for users to read.
